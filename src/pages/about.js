                  <strong>The short version:</strong> I teach web developer
                  classes at college in Denmark and I have been messing around
                  on the WWW since it became a thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>A bit more:</strong> Once upon a time, when I was a
                  little boy, I messed around with my Commodore64 and a casette
                  bay full of games. Assembly was the language and I just wanted
                  to have infinite lives in my games. That was my introduction
                  to programming.
                </p>
                <Img
                  fluid={data.cmd64.childImageSharp.fluid}
                  alt="An old Commodore 64 with a casette bay"
                />
                <p>
                  Later, I discovered Commodore Basic on my Amiga 500. And then
                  came along the 90ies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The World Wide Web was suddenly a thing, and the minister of
                  state in Denmark had decreed that all citizens should have
                  access to it. My family got a spanking new 56k dial-up modem
                  and I was sold! Not literally sold, don't worry. My parents
                  were good parents. They'd never do anything like that. I
                  promise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The very first website I made was a small information site
                  about an aquarium club my friend and I had started. It had
                  animated GIFs, marquee text, and a "This homepage is best
                  viewed with Internet Explorer" logo. And it was built using
                  tables, of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                  9 years later I graduated college with a Bachelors degree in
                  Pedagogy and Didactics. And now I teach budding web developers
                  all about the fantastic world of programming - a true passion
                  of mine.
